Hey folks! This is Dave Albert for a quick take. I have been I've been really slow to update the podcast because I've found multiple things that I wanted to talk about and I've tried to group them together and it hasn't really worked and then I get too busy so I've decided to come up with quick takes which are going to be smaller chunks of five to ten minutes that will have basically one topic. So, I've got a few of these lined up that should be released the same time as this intro to quick takes.

I want to make sure that I can get some some content out there for for people who can learn from what I've learned over the course of the two years building Medit and you know, hope to save people time or at least give them a perspective from what I've through already. Some of the ideas I've got are about our our stock, tech stack. So why we chose MongoDB, why we chose Kubernetes, why we're planning to use Vue JS over something like React JS, while we chose to go with native mobile applications as opposed to using React Native or some other hybrid.

I think I can also throw out smaller pieces of information on some of the meetups I go to, or some of the other interesting things that happen that don't really fit in a longer form podcast. I still plan to do some longer form ones. And definitely excuse me, some of the interviews that I've got in motion will will be much longer form than the quick takes so that we can delve into different topics with different people I work with, and other people that I'm interested in finding out their perspective. Either as they're building their company after they've built it, or some of the people on my own team or potentially people who are considering going into the startup world and have a good conversation with them about what I've learned what what they're bringing into their new venture, and how the information can help the people out there who might listen.So that's pretty much what the the idea of a quick take is.

This one appears to be quite shorter than what I expect most of the the ones in the future to be. This looks like we're at about three minutes, so I doubt many people actually listen to this one but if you're wondering what's a what's a what's a QT, what's quick take that's what that is and this is the reasoning for it.  So hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions or any specific suggestions, feel free to email me podcast@dave-albert.com 

Until next time remember any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
