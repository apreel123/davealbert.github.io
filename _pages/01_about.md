Hi there,  I‚Äôm Dave Albert.  Currently I am the CTO of [One15](https://one15.co) we are busy building [Medit](https://medit.online). I used to work for Symantec as an Senior Principal Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering on the Infrastructure team for the Norton business unit in Dublin, Ireland. Originally from a pretty small town in West Virginia in the U.S.A., I moved countries to Ireland about 10 years ago.

I love all things tech and digital.  I have been in love with computers since I was 9 years old and my dad brought home a Compaq Portable.  I remember placing clear tape over the 5 1/4‚Ä≥ floppy disk to tinker with the code on some of the ‚Äúpublic domain‚Äù games we had to make them easier.  Things haven‚Äôt changed too much since then.  I still love programming and Linux SysAdmin tasks at my day job, and pretty much any other tech related activities or learnings.

The reason for this site is I want to discuss some of the technology I use, want to use, or really don‚Äôt want to use. I also hope to improve my writing style.  üòâ

Thanks for reading!
