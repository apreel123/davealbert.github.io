* Docker
* Ansible
* RunDeck
* CentOS
* Ubuntu
* Vagrant
* NodeJS / JavaScript
* Python

* Elixir/Clojure/Haskell - These I want to make time for badly
* Pebble watch, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, other microcontrollers
* Agile/Lean
* Audiobooks and podcast I find useful


If there's anything specific you'd like to know more about let me know and I'll try to find some value to add to the discussion.
