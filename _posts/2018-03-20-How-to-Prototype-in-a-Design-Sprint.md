## [How to Prototype in a Design Sprint](https://www.meetup.com/Design-Sprint-Ireland/events/248533005/){:target="_blank"}

This is the meetup I attended and I wanted to get out a few of the key points and my take on them down. 

*This is the synopsys*:

> In a Design Sprint, prototyping day is Thursday. This is where you will create a testable prototype for Friday's user tests.

> Thursday is about illusion. You've got an idea for a great solution. Instead of taking weeks, months or, heck, even years building that solution, you’re going to fake it. In one day, you’ll make a prototype that appears real. And on Friday your customers will forget their surroundings and just react!

> Prototypes are easier to build then you think. These days, thanks to the internet, there are a crazy amount of easy to use prototyping tools available. Most of them free! In this session, we will show you some of the tools that we use when prototyping and share our experiences of prototyping best practices.

> The prototype mindset:
> 1. You can prototype anything
> 2. Prototypes are disposable
> 3. Build just enough to learn, but not more
> 4. The prototype must appear real
