Thanks to <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/" target="_blank">this post</a> I was able to understand how to move from Wordpress (which had a mysql error by the way) to [Jekyll on Github Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} in one evening while lying in bed ... I should be sleeping now really.

Well I've added a little more here today (Sunday the 11th) but I haven't decided if I'll move the other posts, or more likely start fresh since most of my posts have either been reposted to LinkedIn and/or Medium. The real need I have is for some different landing pages I have for my social media profiles.

If you are curious you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/davealbert/davealbert.github.io){:target="_blank}. I can't say it's impressive, but if you are just looking in to jekyll it might be worth a look.

Update

As of 2018-02-11 19:20 [dave-albert.com](https://dave-albert.com){:target="_blank"} has come back from the dead! Now to run setup automated backups.  I had them when the site was in Digital Ocean, but didn't get to it when it was moved to Azure. Now will I keep it or move everything here? hmmmmmm...
