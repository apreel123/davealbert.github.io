Goodbye WordPress - Hello Jekyll
===

I've been relatively happy with WordPress, especially since I haven't posted very
much in the past. I still am using it for some sites, but for this one, no more.
Over the 3 day weekend for St. Patrick's day, I finally finished moving the site 
between some other smaller work bits and some family time.


Why
===

So why did I bother moving? Well there are a few reasons listed here:



Terminal/Cli
---

 I live in a terminal, and it's pretty hard to update WordPress from vim. Now, I
 can make updating the blog part of my normal work flow, including editing it off-line.
 Also with git branching, I can have posts in progress.  This let's be just add small
 bits as I like the merge or PR to move a post live.



Patching/Maintenance
---


It's kind of a hassle having to take the time and effort to keep a VM patched and running, along with updating
WordPress itself as well as the plugins is kind of a pain when you got dozens of other
hosts to worry about.  Also there are security concerns if you don't do this for WordPress.
Now it's GitHub's problem ðŸ˜œ. 


Simplicity
---

*Still taling about the terminal here*

I've been on a move to more and more simplicity where I can, I've started using `Alpine` for mail again.
This is a terminal based mail client that is based on `Pine` which was my goto many years ago.
I've also started using `slack-term` for my main work Slack team.  I still use
the full featured applications for some heavier tasks, but with `tmux` I can do
all the things I need to with out taking my hands off the keyboard. Except to pick up
my coffee cup.

Also with WordPress to me it felt like a production to make a post where as using
vim is just putting some of my thoughts down over time then publishing with a `git push`.
I think this will make it more likely for me to post updates.  I have a number of posts
I've been wanting to get out, but haven't felt like going though the "ordeal" of it.


Cost
---

Well the small vps I was using isn't much of a cost, but zero < any amount so there's that.



What's Next?
===

Well hopefully more posts (also hopefully useful/interesting).  And of course I'll
be poking around Jekyll and seeing what tweaks I can make.  Anyone seen any really
nice sites built on Jekyll with something especially compelling?
