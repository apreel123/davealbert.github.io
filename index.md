Please bear with me while updating the site to a new platform, it's not a major priority.  I'm mostly just playing with Jekyll when I have a couple minutes at a time.  It's as more a learning thing than a real project, but I plan for this to be my main site in the long run.

If you want more of me you can find me on the following platforms:

{% include contact.md %}

My old school [textfiles](/textfiles/)

What I'm up to [Now](/now)

Visits to this page: <span style="font-weight: bold;" id="counter">???</span> -- <i>90's stlye</i> :P <i>(built with an AWS Lambda)
