Infrastructure
==============

Being part of the NDRC we get credits for AWS and Azure, so we are experimenting
with both of those.  The majority of production will be running in AWS, but we
have elements running in Azure.  When price is the most important factor I 
really like Digital Ocean.



Backend Code
============

Nodejs with Expressjs is my main choice for web and api development. 
We use python for some AI/ML functionality.
I think I'll be investigating golang in the future for non-web heavy servers in
the future.



Frontend Web
============

It depends on how in depth the project is. If it's a smallish project, I'll 
just stick with JQuery.  I've used Angular version 1 in the past, but think
anything new will probably be built with reactjs.



Mobile
======

I'm an iOS guy and like objective-c, but I've pretty much switched to swift 3.
Our current project will involve an Android app, so I'll get a chance to dig in
to Android Java soon. I haven't had good luck with any of the hybrid solutions
so far.  React-Native looks very promising, but seems to me if you don't have
an army of programmers, you're gonna have a bad time.




Database
========

My first choice is often MongoDB, but if there's a lot of relational connections
I would have used MySQL in the past.  I'm thinking of spending a bit more time
learning more about postgress.



Sysadmin/DevOps
===============

Ansible is my number one choice, but still have several shell scripts floating
around. But the key is to automate as much as possible.
