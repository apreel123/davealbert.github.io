About:
======

For no reason at all, I thought I'd do a strange thing and basically do my 
twitter feed as a text file. I don't know why, I'm just not right.  It's not 
really for anyone, just myself. If you en up hear I'd love to hear about how
that happened.  Email or Twitter (see footer)


"Tweets"

Tue  8 Aug 2017 17:06:11 IST

Tue  8 Aug 2017 16:06:39 IST

 - First "Tweet" like some weirdo in a text file.



How
===

The script/function I use to avoid having to write this manually.


~ $ type -f tweet
tweet () {
        FILENAME=old-skool-twitter.txt
        TMPFILE=tweet.tmp
        LINENUM=18
        pushd ~/code/davealbert.github.io/textfiles
        head -n $LINENUM $FILENAME > $TMPFILE
        date >> $TMPFILE
        echo "- $*" >> $TMPFILE
        tail -n +$LINENUM $FILENAME >> $TMPFILE
        cat $TMPFILE > $FILENAME
        git add $FILENAME
        git commit -m "OSK-Tweet: $*"
        git push
        rm $TMPFILE
}
